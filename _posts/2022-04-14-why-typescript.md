   Writing Javascript at scale is not easy, however, Javascript has experienced a lot of improvements over the past decade making it modern, less buggy,
predictable and fun to write. The introduction of classes, arrow functions, among other nicesities have contributed to its continued domination within the industry and among,
beginner programmers.

The growth and prevalence of Javascript did not go unnoticed by the big tech, resulting in the development of Typescript by Microsoft. Typescript described itself as `JavaScript with syntax for types.` this helped in making it much easier to write Javascript at scale.

 Still wrapping my head around types, considering I have been writing Ruby for the longest time, but I am getting the groove.
