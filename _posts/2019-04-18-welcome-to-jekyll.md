Here you will find posts about different things I learned and continue to learn on a daily basis. Most of the things will cover software development, but on some occasions I will post about other life's rumblings.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

I really love Ruby so to welcome you I want to say Hello in Ruby:

```ruby
def hello(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
hello('Guest')
#=> prints 'Hi, Guest' to STDOUT.
```

Hope this blog will help you in some way, at some point in time. Above all this blog is a dedication to my daughter Fola, may you enjoy reading these stuff someday.
