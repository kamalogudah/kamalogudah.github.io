So according to my good friend [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) Vim is a clone, with additions, of Bill Joy's vi text editor program for Unix. Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, based it upon the source code for a port of the Stevie editor to the Amiga and released a version to the public in 1991
