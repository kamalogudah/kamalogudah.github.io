So according to my good friend [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) Vim is a clone, with additions, of Bill Joy's vi text editor program for Unix. Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, based it upon the source code for a port of the Stevie editor to the Amiga and released a version to the public in 1991

```
hjkl - moving around in vim
i  - insert mode.
A  - append mode same as insert mode.
ESC -  goes to normal mode.
x - delete a character.
dw - delete a word.
d$ - delete a sentences.
2w - move cursor 2 words forward.
3e - to move the cursor to the end of the third word forward
0 - (zero) to move to the start of the line.
```
